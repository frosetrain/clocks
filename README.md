# clocks

Some command-line clock scripts

clock.py is just a clock in ISO 8601 format

epochalypse.py is how much of 32-bit unix timestamp we have used up before it overflows. So it's the delta-time between 1970 and now divided by the delta-time between 1970 and the overflow

pip.py does the BBC World Service pips

ttyclock.py is going to be a tty clock in the future
